# Cloud Resume Challenge

**Backend repository** of *[resume.amitmehta.cloud](https://resume.amitmehta.cloud)*

This project is inspired by the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) and built using **serverless** cloud services and best practices in **web development**, **CI/CD** and **IAC**.

## Frontend

The frontend code for my resume webpage is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The resume is hosted on **AWS S3**, served via **CloudFront** for CDN, and accessible through a custom domain managed by **Route 53**.

### Architecture

- `HTML` & `CSS`: For the content and style of the resume.
- `JavaScript`: For dynamic functionality, including calling the backend for the view counter functionality.
- `AWS S3`: Static website hosting.
- `CloudFront`: Content Delivery Network (CDN) for global distribution with **OAC** to secure the origin.
- `Route 53`: Manages the DNS for the custom domain.
- `AWS Certificate Manager`: Creates a public certificate for CloudFront to enable HTTPS.
- `Terraform`: Infrastructure as Code (**IaC**) to provision and manage AWS resources. Remote backend is set up in S3 and DynamoDB is used for state locking.
- `AWS SSM Parameter Store`: Used to securely store and manage secrets.
- `GitHub Actions`: Automates the **CI/CD** pipeline to deploy changes to the S3 bucket after every commit.

## Backend

The backend handles the view counter functionality, updating and retrieving the number of times the page has been accessed. It is written in **Python** and hosted on **AWS Lambda**, triggered via **API Gateway**. Data is stored in **Dynamo DB** table.

### Architecture

- `API Gateway`: Receives requests from the frontend.
- `Lambda Function`: Triggered by API Gateway, written in **Python**.
  - Interacts with **DynamoDB** to fetch the view count.
  - Returns the view count to the JavaScript in the frontend.
- `DynamoDB`: Stores the view count.
- `AWS SSM Parameter Store`: Stores and manages secrets securely.
- `Terraform`: Infrastructure as Code (**IaC**) to provision and manage AWS resources. Remote backend is set up in S3 and DynamoDB is used for state locking.
- `GitHub Actions`: Automates the **CI/CD** pipeline to deploy changes to the Lambda Function after every commit.

#### How it Works

1. **JavaScript** on the frontend calls the **API Gateway**.
2. **CORS** enabled on **API Gateway** to allow the requests.
3. **API Gateway** triggers a **Lambda function**.
4. The **Lambda function**, written in Python, interacts with **DynamoDB** to fetch the view count.
5. The view count is returned to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## Terraform Setup

To avoid hard coding bucket names and DynamoDB table names, an `initialize.sh` script is created. This script fetches the necessary parameters from AWS SSM Parameter Store and uses them to configure the `backend.hcl` file through Terraform's partial configuration feature. This setup ensures that the remote backend is properly configured without exposing sensitive information.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using **GitHub Actions** to automate the deployment process. Every commit to the `main` branch triggers the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which:

### Frontend

- **Checks out the repository.**
- **Syncs the content to the S3 bucket.**
- **Invalidates the CloudFront cache.**

### Backend

- **Checks out the repository.**
- **Creates Python package.**
- **Uploads in S3 bucket**
- **Deploys to Lambda Function**
